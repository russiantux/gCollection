# gCollection
a tool to automate the generation of the workshop.lua for GMOD servers.

## Why tho?
Because, I thought I need it for my gmod server,but turns out there's already an online solution that works and looks better then my version. I didn't want all of my time go to waste so I decided to upload it to github is for some reason someone wants to make their own or base their work off my spagetti code.

## Well, how do I use it?
Easily, first make sure you have the node modules ``express`` and ``require`` installed, then go to the directery where you have the files, type ``node index.js`` and it should notify you that it's up and running. Then open the index.html in whatever browser you use. Should be pretty stright forward from that point.

## God, the css on index.html is utter ass
Thank you for notifying me of that Mr.Detective. I simply put the css stuff there and didn't want to put in more effort to make it look pretty. Don't like it? Fix it yourself lol.
